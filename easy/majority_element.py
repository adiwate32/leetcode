# Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

# The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,2,3]
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2
